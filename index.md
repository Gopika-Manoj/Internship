# TATA IIIC INTERNSHIP

### I JOINED AN INTERNSHIP COURSE AT JYOTHI ENGINEERING COLLEGE WHERE I AM A STUDENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING.
### THE INTERNSHIP COURSE WAS OF A 5 DAY JOURNEY HELD FROM 23 JANUARY 2024 TO 27 JANUARY 2024.

## DAY 1

### WE STARTED OF WITH INTRODUCING OURSELVES INTO A 3D DESIGNING SITE [TINKERCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/h8pAe8wPh30-mighty-snaget-jofo/edit)
### I DESIGNED A SMALL HOUSE USING THIS SITE.

### THE AFTERNOON SESSION OF FIRST DAY, WE WERE INTRODUCED TO INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS,ITS APPLICATIONS,AND PROPERTIES OF ARC WELDING ROBOT AND PICK AND PLACE ROBOT.
### THE FIRST DAY OF INTERNSHIP WAS VERY INFORMATIVE AND JOYFULL.

## DAY 2

### THE NEXT DAY WAS CONTINUED WITH THE CLASSES OF INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS AND WE WERE PROVIDED WITH MORE INFORMATIONS OF PICK AND PLACE ROBOT WHICH WAS IN OUR COLLEGE.
### WE PROGRAMMED THE PICK AND PLACE ROBOT WITH THE HELP OF OUR SIR.WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THE FUNCTIONING OF THAT ROBOT.
### LATER WE COMPLETED AN ONLINE COURSE ON YASKAWA SAFETY PRINCIPLES OFFERED BY THE YASKAWA ONLINE TRAINING.
### [CERTIFICATE](DOC-20240124-WA0013..pdf)
### IN THE AFTERNOON SESSION OF DAY 2 WE WERE INTRODUCED TO CREO APP AND ITS APPLICATIONS.
### CREO APP IS ALSO USED FOR DESIGNING 3D SHAPES.WE DESIGNED AN BASIC SHAPE TO GET MORE INFORMATIONS OF ITS TABS AND MENUS AS WE PLANNED TO DESIGN A BALL BEARING ON 3rd DAY.
### THE SHAPE WE DESIGNED IS

### LATER IN THE AFTERNOON SESSION WE HAD THE CLASS OF ARC WELDING ROBOT AND LATER WE PROGRAMMED IT AND WE SAW THE FUNCTIONING OF IT.
  - ### THE ARC WELDING ROBOT IS OF MODEL **AR1440**

## DAY 4

### IT WAS AN WORK FROME HOME DAY,DURING WHICH THIS REPORT WAS CREATED.

## DAY 5

### THIS WAS THE LAST DAY OF INTERNSHIP JOURNEY WHICH INCLUDED AN 'IV'.
### WE VISITED TWO INDUSTRIES NAMELY
  - ### VIJAYA POLYMERS,KALLIPADAM,SHORNUR
  - ### THE METAL INDUSTRIES,KALLIPADM,SHORNUR
#### THE VIJAYA POLYMERS IS A PLASTIC INJECTION MOULDING WORKSHOP
#### THE MAJOR ACTIVITY OF VIJAYA POLYMERS IS MANUFACTURING, SUB-CLASSIFIED INTO MANUFACTURE OF RUBBER AND PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OTHER PLASTIC PRODUCTS.
